# Chat App

This is a full-stack chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to sign up, log in, send messages to each other, and view online status.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up for a new account or log in with existing credentials.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.io enables instant messaging between users with real-time updates.
- **Notification Sounds**: A notification sound is played upon receiving a new message.
